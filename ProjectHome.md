## [MyRoundcube Plugins](https://myroundcube.com) ##
Centralized and simplified management, language translation and plugins updates. [MyRoundcube Plugins](https://myroundcube.com/myroundcube-plugins) are delivered through our mirror servers by one of our own plugins; [Plugin Manager](https://myroundcube.com/myroundcube-plugins/plugin-manager). Plugin Manager is the one responsible for bringing all the goodies together. It adds the possibility for users to enable/disable plugins (at the user-level) while helping administrators stay current with updates, up-to-date plugins, bug fixes, centralized downloads, documentation and more. Plugin Manager does not modify Roundcube core files nor it will install plugins automatically.

You can use [MyRoundcube Load Splitter](https://myroundcube.com/myroundcube-plugins/load_splitter-plugin/load-splitter-service) Service to serve static files for your webmail users, or use your own remote hosts or CDN provider instead.

We have multiple servers geographically distributed delivering static files via BGP Anycast provided by [BuyVM](https://myroundcube.com/recommends/vps/buyvm/) to make sure your users are always served static files from the closest MyRoundcube servers in the route.

The service is provided completely free of charge. This is yet another BIG thanks to all of you who are active participants in supporting our work.

Try it and you may find it useful, specially if your webmail is sitting in a limited pipe or at home.
